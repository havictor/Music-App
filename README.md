# Music App

A website that allows users to find current and upcoming music events.

## User Stories
A user may attempt the following:
- Enter an artist.  The site will display a list of all upcoming events.
- Enter an artist and city.  The site will display a list of upcoming events, limited to the city.
- Enter a start and end date.  The site will display events only within the date range.

The website will also provide a list of similar artists to the artist searched.  Each similar artist could be linked, such that upon clicking, a new search will be submitted with the similar artist's name.

## APIs
The following APIs will be integrated into the website:
- [Bandsintown](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0), upcoming events
- [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/api), similar artists
